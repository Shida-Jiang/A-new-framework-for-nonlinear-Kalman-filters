# A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters

This is the code for the research paper with the same title. In the paper, we introduced a new framework that can improve the performance of all types of nonlinear Kalman filters by more than an order of magnitude. The nonlinear Kalman filters investigated in the paper include the extended Kalman filter, second-order extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, and cubature Kalman filter.

Running these codes allows you to reproduce all the figures in the paper.

The five files correspond to five different use cases.
