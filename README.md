# A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters

This is the code for the research paper with the same title. In the paper, we introduced a new framework that can improve the performance of all types of nonlinear Kalman filters by more than an order of magnitude, such as extended Kalman filter, second-order extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, cubature Kalman filter, etc.

Running this code allows you to reproduce all the figures in the paper.

The five files correspond to five different use cases.
